The files are named appropriately, and the file named "extra" has the code for the pretrained model using Gensim.

The models were run on Google Colab, and are stored on https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/personal/mayank_goel_research_iiit_ac_in/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx

Instructions to use them are on the notebook themselves.
